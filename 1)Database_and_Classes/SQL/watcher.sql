Well, Hertz offered a Rent-A-Racer program that would let you slide behind the wheel of a special Hertz-liveried Shelby Mustang for only $17 a day. Those days might be long gone, but the idea of renting a high-performance pony car from Hertz is apparently alive and well. Hertz is rolling a new fleet of hopped-up Mustangs through its showrooms in the legendary Hertz Mustang livery.</p><p>The Ford Mustang Shelby GT500-H might be a mouthful, but it’s just a long way of saying you want a 900+ hp Mustang. As the name suggests, this Mustang is based on the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 and most will wear the iconic gold stripes that tell the world that it’s a special Hertz edition.

With that in mind, the Lexus UX needs to show prospective buyers what Lexus represents, hopefully drawing them deep enough into the brand to spring for a Lexus LX 600 down the line.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">After a handful of years in the market, Lexus is giving the UX a serious update. Alongside interior changes, the Lexus UX is moving exclusively to a hybrid powertrain for 2023. This pivot might seem like a huge shakeup for the UX lineup, but actually it just means Lexus is cutting the base-model UX 200 from the lineup and now making the UX 250h the new floor for the nameplate.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">That means the only powertrain will be the 2.0-liter I4 that works with the two-motor hybrid system, which currently powers the 2022 Lexus UX 250h. In 2022, this combination was good enough for 181 hp and 39 combined mpg.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Joining the powertrain shakeup is a revised cabin. The old infotainment system is out and is replaced by a standard 8.0-inch touchscreen media system or an optional 12.3-inch touchscreen. Judging by the photographs, Lexus did away with the UX’s touchpad controller and the hand-rest controls on the center console, but the shift to the more modern touchscreen will probably be welcomed by many.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The ’23 Lexus UX should perform better than the current models, too. Lexus revised the steering calibration, stiffened the shell and revised the suspension tuning. The updated Lexus sees 20 more spot welding points in the structure to make it more rigid than the outgoing model. A Lexus F-Sport Handling package should make it more nimble and stable and comes with performance dampers and the Lexus Active Variable Suspension system.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri; margin-bottom: 0px;\">Ultimately, these changes shouldn’t move the needle too far on the invoice. Of course, the base price will probably rise because of the removal of the Lexus UX 200 from the lineup, but the price should stay underneath $40,000. We’ll see official pricing soon because Lexus says these ’23 UX 250h models are going to hit dealers this summer.</p></div>', 'lexus.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 312322, '2', 'May 14, 2022'),

It joins the Land Rover family as the third installment in the nameplate and replaces a quickly aging second-generation model. As you’d expect, the Range Rover Sport follows the larger Range Rover nearly in lockstep, with a similar design and an updated engine array. While this is generally good news, the updated Range Rover Sport does ax one of its coolest second-generation features.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">If you’re wondering what’s missing, it’s under the hood. The 5.0-liter supercharged V8 won’t join the updated Range Rover Sport, just like it\'s moving away from the larger Range Rover. The top engine is a 4.4-liter turbocharged V8. While it probably won’t have the ridiculous exhaust note of the outgoing 5.0-liter, the new mill does make good power: 523 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque. If you want less power—at a lower price—Land Rover is also offering a 3.0-liter inline-six that’s assisted by either a mild-hybrid system or a plug-in hybrid system.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The base mild hybrid 3.0-liter Range Rover Sport makes a combined 355 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. That number shoots up on the P400-badged models to 395 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. Plug-in hybrid Range Rover Sports send 434 hp and 619 lb-ft of torque to the wheels. Managing power from all of these engine options is an eight-speed ZF automatic that feeds Land Rover’s intelligent all-wheel-drive system. Land Rover also promises a Range Rover Sport EV, but that’s not scheduled until the 2024 model year.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Of course, the Range Rover Sport has more to offer than just new powertrains. The styling takes the minimalist approach, like the full-sized Range Rover. Flush-mounted door handles and stealth-inspired styling help the Range Rover Sport slice through the air with a relatively low 0.29 coefficient of drag.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">This sleek design language carries over to the interior as well. Land Rover stuck with its new Pivi Pro infotainment system, which is controlled by a 13.1-inch curved touchscreen that’s affixed to the middle of the dash. Below the infotainment screen, you’ll find Land Rover’s digital climate controls, the dynamic controls, and the gear selector. Sitting in front of the driver is a 13.7-inch digital instrument cluster that’s dubbed Interactive Driver Display4. Wireless Apple CarPlay is standard, as well as a 15-watt wireless device charger.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Supporting the new Range Rover Sport is the standard Dynamic Air Suspension, which changes the pressure in the air springs relative to the vehicle’s drive mode. On the top-tier Range Rover Sport First Edition, you’ll find the more sophisticated Dynamic Air Suspension Pro, which gives you all the dynamic control you’d see in the standard suspension but adds increased roll control.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Joining the new tech is an optional all-wheel-steering system, which can kick the rear wheels out 7.3-degrees to help make the Range Rover Sport easier to maneuver. Joining this all-wheel-steering system is torque vectoring and an Electronic Active Differential, which should provide sharp directional control over the Range Rover Sport.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">If you’re interested in snagging your own Range Rover Sport, the folks at Land Rover say it\'s available to order now. The base model starts at $84,350 including destination charges. If you want to jump into a V8-powered Range Rover Sport P530 First Edition, it starts at $122,850. Though, don’t rush: First Edition models will be available for the entire model year.<br></p></div>', 'rangerover.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 219623, '4', 'May 14, 2022'),

The ultra-high-end marque crafts machines for the most discerning—and wealthy—individuals on earth who want the most comfortable car money can buy. Rolls-Royce is also working to update its machines to make them even sharper than before, which explains the arrival of the Phantom Series II: a lightly updated version of its eighth-generation Phantom. More importantly, the company is launching a new over-the-top trim level, the Phantom Platino. Or, as we’d say in English: Phantom Platinum.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The updates coming to the Phantom are subtle. The Phantom Series II sees a slight change to the grille that puts further emphasis on the Spirit of Ecstasy and the Rolls-Royce badge. Following the trend of expanded lighting, Rolls-Royce also illuminated the grille. New stainless steel wheels help make the Series II stand out against the pedestrian eighth-generation Phantom. The sheetmetal is effectively the same as the current Phantom, but I doubt many were complaining about the car’s looks.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">While these changes are fairly minor, the Phantom Series II does expand technologically. Debuting on this Phantom Series II is a new infotainment platform called Rolls-Royce Connected, which integrates the navigation system into the Rolls-Royce’s Whispers application and enables you to send destinations directly to the car from the app. This system also shows your Phantom’s location and security status and can connect you with a local dealer to solve any maintenance issues.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The new Phantom Platino variant might not be crafted from platinum ore, but it\'s full of innovative materials. Rolls-Royce is experimenting with alternative interior trim that mixes bamboo fiber, 3D-printed ceramics, and the Rolls-Royce Starlight headliner with traditional materials such as wood and leather.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">All in, these changes are light, even for the Platino, though they’re apparently what customers want. You can expect the updated Phantom to cost roughly the same as the current model, so be ready to part with about $500,000 before placing your order.</p></div>', 'rollsoyce.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 183063, '5', 'May 14, 2022'),

And also to haul bachelor and bachelorette parties around. These aren’t accusations you can level at the new Bentley Bentayga EWB and its modest extension.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The EWB is seven inches longer than the regular Bentayga, with that expansion entirely within the wheelbase. Delivering it has required some major surgery, including new rear doors and side stampings, plus revised roof and floor panels. But the greatest tribute we can play to Bentley’s design team is that the stretch is well enough integrated to be barely noticeable. It certainly doesn’t look like it should be wearing a boomerang aerial and some faded whitewalls.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The logic of lengthening the Bentayga was equally simple: an acknowledgement that an increasing number of the rich buyers who get chauffeured are, in line with the rest of the car market, doing so in SUVs. According to Chris Cole, the Bentayga product manager, the EWB is intended for the same part of the market the XL Mulsanne sedan formerly occupied before its emissions-enforced retirement in 2020.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">That’s also why—although the EWB will sit at the top of the Bentayga range–it won’t be sold with the most powerful W12 engine available with the regular wheelbase. Bentley’s argument is that the 542-hp 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 is plenty fast enough in this part of the market, and it’s hard to imagine too many owners will be wanting anything more than its claimed combination of a 4.5-second 0-60 mph time and a 180 mph top speed, whether riding in front or back. Although unconfirmed, Bentley insiders also hint that an EWB using the plug-in hybrid powertrain, with a 3.0-liter V6, is also likely.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Beyond the need to find longer parking spaces, Bentley doesn’t want Bentayga EWB buyers to suffer inconvenience from the increase in length. It will get an actively steered rear axle as standard, this delivering a 38.3-ft turning circle which is actually smaller than that of the regular wheelbase car. It will also come with Bentley’s 48-Volt active antiroll system as standard.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The expanded dimensions has allowed Bentley to make bigger changes inside. The Bentayga EWB will be available with the same separate rear seats as the regular car, or a three-wide bench, but Bentley will also be offering it with the option of what it calls its new Airline Seat. (This inspired by the sort you’ll find in a private jet, not economy class.) This has 22 different planes of movement and also incorporates heat and humidity monitoring, with active thermal management to ensure occupants are kept at a comfortable temperature. It also has a Relax mode, which will recline the backrest by up to 40 degrees while simultaneously moving the front passenger seat forward and deploying a motorized footrest.</p><div><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Bentley was the first luxury manufacturer to launch an SUV, with the segment now filling up with multiple rivals. The EWB should be seen as an acknowledgement that the Bentayga’s appeal is evolving as this part of the market gets busier, with the company reckoning that up to 45 percent of worldwide buyers are likely to opt for the longer and more spacious option. Prices will be announced closer to sales beginning later this year.</p></div></div>', 'bentley.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 378840, '6', 'May 14, 2022'),

Thankfully, this version is a Euro-only spec; those headed stateside will offer plenty of joy.\r\n', '<div style=\"font-family: \"Segoe UI\"; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The clock is ticking on Alfa Romeo’s combustion powerplants, more rapidly than for almost any other automaker. The Italian company is committed to exclusively selling EVs as soon as 2027. Of comparable sized automakers, only Jaguar is set to move more quickly, the British brand saying it will have made its own transition to full electrification by 2025. Yet while Jaguar has offered a competitive EV for several years, the well regarded i-Pace, Alfa is only just taking the first tentative step on its electric journey.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">That’s with the car we’ve driven here, the new Tonale, a compact luxury crossover that effectively understudies the Stelvio in the corporate portfolio. Although the first US-spec cars will be getting a conventional 256-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged-four, the version that will be launched first in Europe features a 48-Volt hybrid system, and Alfa is committed to offering a plug-in with an electrically driven rear axle on both sides of the Atlantic soon afterwards.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Although Autoweek likes to encourage automakers in their electric endeavors, I can report that US buyers are not going to be missing out on a charismatic powerplant by the decision not to bring this hybrid stateside. This is a joyless powerplant in no danger of making any list of Alfa’s many combustion highlights. It uses a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine featuring the mild novelties of Miller Cycle timing and a variable geometry turbocharger to help boost economy, and working in conjunction with both a 20-hp 48-Volt electric motor that sits between it and the standard seven-speed twin-clutch gearbox. The total peak output is just 158 hp—pitted against 3365 lbs of car—and is delivered exclusively to the front wheels through a seven-speed double-clutch transmission.</p><p></p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The new engine isn’t any more exciting in reality than it is on paper. Unlike most 48-Volt hybrid systems, the Tonale can power itself under pure electric power at more than just maneuvering speeds, although there is often an obvious gap in torque as it hands over propulsion to the conventional engine. Although subdued under gentle use, the hybrid sounds harsh when worked hard, and has no enthusiasm to rev beyond the 5750 rpm at which peak power arrives. The launch cars also suffered from a slightly inconsistent throttle response, feeling like it continued to apply power for a fraction of a second after the gas pedal was lifted.</p><p></p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Yet this matters little as Alfa has no plans to bring the less powerful hybrid system to the US. The good news is that the rest of the car is good enough to show solid promise for the versions that will make it over here.</p><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.666666666666666;\">Design is a definite strong point. You will forgive a good looking car much more than a bad looking one, a principle that Alfa Romeo has often pushed to breaking point with some of its beautiful, fragile models. Yet although a compact crossover still doesn’t feel like a particularly obvious </span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">recipient for the company’s famous badge, the result is a seriously handsome junior SUV—one that manages to look much bigger and more grown up than similarly sized alternatives like the Audi Q3 and BMW X1.

Space is good up front and reasonable in back, there is a good range of driving position adjustment and cruising refinement is excellent. The new UI system also works cleanly and intuitively, and the Tonale also supports Alexa voice inputs, being intelligent enough to correctly interpret commands like “play classic rock” or “navigate me to a good pizzeria.” (Easy in Italy, less so in the Midwest.)</span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.666666666666666;\"> </span></p></div></div> ', 'alfa.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 516195, '8', 'May 14, 2022'),

Buzz. While many of our readers probably remember the retro-themed 2001 Microbus concept (which still looks fantastic, by the way), the more direct impetus for Wolfsburg\'s development of an electric model was tied to the darkest days of Volkswagen\'s diesel crisis, which still feels simultaneously recent, but also quite distant in many ways. The crisis itself forced a reckoning within Volkswagen, hastening the demise of not only the diesel era but also an understanding that gas-engined models may not be around forever.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The automaker\'s newfound electric religion prompted a flurry of concepts to emerge, with a Microbus-styled model once again quickly making its way to the top. The ID. Buzz concept, as it was dubbed at the time, was among the first new electric models to be greenlit by the management in Wolfsburg, though its journey from concept to production would not be as short as that of another gas-engined model.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">A new documentary by Volkswagen, featured below, offers a close look at the journey of the ID.

Developed with Toyota, the Solterra is one of three EV models that will be underpinned by the e-TNGA platform, with the first two models having been revealed by Toyota and Lexus, respectively.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Subaru will offer the Solterra in three trim levels—Premium, Limited, and Touring—with the Premium trim kicking things off at $46,220, before any state or federal incentives, including the $7500 federal rebate for which the Solterra is very eligible.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">All flavors will serve up an all-wheel-drive, dual-motor layout, and a 72.8-kWh battery, with the Premium trim rated at 228 miles. The automaker says the Solterra will feature a new Symmetrical All-Wheel-Drive system, with the model offering a total of 215 hp and 249 lb-ft of torque from its two motors. These numbers are identical to those of the AWD Toyota bZ4X, with the Solterra featuring grip control and downhill assist control in addition to two snow modes and a mud mode with all trim levels.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">An 8-inch horizontal touchscreen is standard on this base model, as is Subaru\'s EyeSight safety suite with intersection collision-avoidance support, pre-collision brake assist, emergency steering assist, and dynamic radar cruise control with lane tracing assist.

A few other items are added on this trim level, which starts at $49,720, including heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, power driver\'s seat, LED foglights, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, and 20-inch wheels. The penalty for the larger wheels, however, is a 222-mile EPA rating, at least on paper.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The range-topping Touring trim, which starts at $53,220, throws in a few extra goodies including ventilated front seats, panoramic moonroof with power sunshade, and digital rear-view mirror. This version is rated at 222 miles as well.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">All flavors of the Solterra will feature DC fast charging capability, which will allow them to charge up to 80% in under an hour, according to Subaru.

This special-edition 911 borrows a major design detail from the early \'70s 911 Carrera RS 2.7: the ducktail spoiler. Of course, the wild spoiler isn’t the only part of the Carrera RS 2.7’s DNA that made its way into this new limited-edition machine.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Based on the standard-production Porsche 911 Turbo S, this wide-body 911 features the engine from the current-generation Porsche 911 Turbo. This turbocharged 3.7-liter flat-six was retuned by Porsche to make less power than what you’ll see from the Turbo or Turbo S. This 911 Sport Classic squeezes 543 hp and 442 lb-ft of torque from this 3.7-liter boxer mill. That’s down 29 hp and 111 lb-ft of torque compared to the 911 Turbo’s tune. The reason? This special Porsche feeds its power exclusively through a seven-speed manual transmission connected to the rear wheels. The sacrifice in sheer power could be worth rowing your own gears.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The rest of the 911 Sport Classic should help you enjoy this potent flat-six to its fullest. Standard ceramic composite brakes are clamped by black Porsche calipers. The 911 Sport Classic also includes a special exhaust, the Sport Chrono Package, and Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control into the standard sticker price. Porsche also added its Active Suspension Management system to the list of high-performance standard features.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">While there’s no question about this special 911\'s overall performance, its real draw is its styling. Like the aforementioned spoiler, this 911 Sport Classic borrows designs from previous Porsches. For example, the sport grey metallic paint harkens back to the fashion grey finish found on the Porsche 356, while the wheels are a nod to the beloved Fuchs five-spoke rims. The interior is also a nod to classic Porsche design and features patterned cloth inserts on the seats and door panels.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The best news: the 911 Sport Classic is coming to the US. It’s not clear how many of the 1,250 examples are slated for us stateside, so you should probably get ahold of your local Porsche dealer to earmark yours as soon as possible. Porsche says pricing will be available closer to the 911 Sport Classic’s arrival in showrooms later this year. Though, considering the exclusive parts list and the limited production, it’s safe to say this will not be cheap.</p></div>', 'porsche.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 363972, '14', 'May 14, 2022');

Mecum’s sale at Kissimmee not only kicks off the year of collector car trading but is also one of the most important stops on Mecum’s calendar. This makes it a perfect place for pieces of automotive history or highly sought-after machines to find new homes. Joining its ranks this year is Bob Hirohata’s 1951 Mercury.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">We took a look at this Barris-built Mercury’s history when it was first confirmed to be headed towards the auction block. As its name implies, the Hirohata Mercury was built for Robert “Bob” Hirohata by the team at Barris Kustoms in 1952. Despite its relatively short time under construction, Hirohata’s Mercury went on to dominate the car show circuit, grace magazine covers, and eventually see some motion picture work. As tends to be the case with custom cars, Hirohata continually updated his prized Mercury—and as is also often the case, these cars tend to fall out of favor as they age, and Hirohata’s Mercury is no exception.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">After trading hands a few times, Hirohata’s once-loved Mercury sat at a used-car lot. This formerly groundbreaking custom looked dated, used, and was probably heading in the same direction as other prominent custom cars like the Barris “Kopper Kart” or Ed Roth’s “Mysterion,” and just disappear to time. Fortunately for every custom car-obsessed person in the world, Jim McNiel managed to find the money to buy Bob Hirohata’s Mercury from the used car lot in 1959 and owned it until his death in 2018. Under McNiel’s ownership, the Hirohata Mercury was restored, shown, and won its class at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in 2015.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">It’s at the prestigious Pebble Beach Concours that Chasing Classic Cars host and F40 Motorsports owner Wayne Carini enters the Hirohata Mercury’s history. While shooting his TV show at Pebble Beach, the Hirohata Mercury’s painter Herschel “Junior” Conway connected McNiel and Carini. Carini recalls, “We talk for a little while and he (McNiel) said, ‘Would you sit in the car with me?’ So, I said sure I’m thrilled to sit in it. He said, ‘I just want to tell you something. I’ve appointed you to help my family sell the car. I’d like to get your permission to tell my family that you will help them sell this car on my passing.’” Carini fired back to McNiel, “Jim, you look pretty damn healthy to me.”</p><div><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Three years later McNiel’s passing started the ball rolling towards the auction block. Carini didn’t take the responsibility of helping rehome a legendary car lightly. He said, “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me. It’s an icon in the car world and now it’s been given to me as being the person that’s in charge of helping his (McNiel’s) family sell the car. And a lot of weight is put on my shoulders to do the best job I possibly can for the family.”</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri; margin-bottom: 0px;\">About the plan to sell this Mercury, Carini said, “We made a decision as to where to sell it. Now, we had a few offers right up front, and the family decided that the best way to make it fair, and for them to possibly get as much money as they could for the car, was to go to auction and give everybody a fair chance at buying it.”</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><br></p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri; margin-bottom: 0px;\">Wisely, Carini didn’t take the task of helping the Hirohata Mercury trade hands alone. Carini flagged his friend Ken Gross for help. Gross, for the unfamiliar, is not only a renowned journalist and walking history book of car culture; he’s also one of the people responsible for helping cars like the Hirohata Mercury see the green at Pebble Beach.<br></p><div><p></p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">“I’ve often said, there is the Hirohata Mercury, and then there are all the other customs. To me, this is the definitive custom car,” said Gross. “I say that partly because of its notoriety, fame, movies, Barris, and the rest of it, but it’s just better looking than the others. The combination of this two-tone paint, the Buick side sweep and the way the car was hard-topped… It pioneered a number of features that people copied, but no one copied them quite as well as this car.”</p><p></p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Gross likely thought the same when he and his judging crew had to pick a winner out of a group of some of the most historically significant Mercury customs at Pebble Beach. Gross explains: “First of all, to win the class, we judged those cars using as much of the Pebble Beach judging system… So you can judge a custom car that way in terms of restoration accuracy, quality of paint, and so on and so forth. We had a couple of those cars that were either 99 or 100 points on a standard judging scale. What makes the difference are those three points for field presence, prominence, fame. Those last three points often separate a group of 100 point cars. It’s subjective, but that’s kind of what you have to do because a lot of cars can score 100 points in terms of restoration perfection. So you have to look at those almost intangibles.”</p></div></div></div>', 'hirohata.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 412524, '15', 'May 15, 2022'),

The red flares had been lit, Kostas Tsimikas had set off on a lap of honour and Liverpool were headed for their supporters but their captain was nearer the halfway line, bent over a distraught Mason Mount. For the second time this season, a penalty miss decided a cup final between evenly-matched teams and this time Kepa Arrizabalaga had not ballooned a spot kick into orbit.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Rather, Mount had been denied by Alisson, joining Jerzy Dudek and Bruce Grobbelaar among the Liverpool goalkeepers who have secured silverware in shootouts. For Mount, however, this was a horribly familiar feeling. He has lost at Wembley in finals from the Championship play-offs to Euro 2020, via the Carabao Cup and now three FA Cups. He could be forgiven for wishing the 2024 Champions League final were not being staged at England’s national stadium. He is on course for a clean sweep of silver medals from his trips here.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The nature of such occasions means someone has to be the fall guy. In a sense, there were two: Cesar Azpilicueta has had one of the great Chelsea careers but his omission from the starting line-up was an indication of a dip in form and that the younger, rawer legs of Trevoh Chalobah were instead trusted against Luis Diaz. Off the bench, the captain seemed a safe choice to take the second spot kick. He clipped the outside of the post; it felt another sign that his powers of reliability were diminishing.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">For him, a cameo came without saving graces. For Mount, the preceding two hours offered evidence of excellence. He found a diving Alisson with his spot-kick after evading his outfield colleagues. He used the channels either side of Henderson and showed the ability to link up with Christian Pulisic and the overlapping wing-backs alike. Thomas Muller was nicknamed the Raumdeuter, the interpreter of space. Mount’s origins in Portsmouth may prevent him from sharing that nickname but, if Thomas Tuchel reverts to his native tongue, he may find few better ways of describing a player with an uncanny ability to pop up unchecked.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">He had teed up Pulisic for perhaps Chelsea’s best chance; if Mount missed chances in the Carabao Cup final, this time the American was the one with the profligate streak. But he often plays well against Liverpool and each had brought Chelsea back into the game with his cleverness after Liverpool buffeted them for the first 15 minutes.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Chelsea’s resilience comes in many forms and, remarkably for a club who were long seen as a billionaire’s plaything, it has come to be their defining characteristic. Liverpool have won two trophies at their expense this season. In another respect, however, they cannot shake them off.</p><div><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The quadruple chasers have recorded a different sort of quartet against the outgoing champions of Europe: a draw at Anfield and another at Stamford Bridge in the league, a Carabao Cup final where they were still level after 120 minutes and again in an FA Cup final. After 420 minutes, the only thing to separate them this season is penalties. Jurgen Klopp can feel prophetic even when he is being light-hearted. He had joked it would go to extra time and it did. Perhaps it was inevitable: Tuchel can cancel out a predecessor at Mainz and Dortmund in everything except the artificial drama of the shootout.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">There can be an improbable element to their resistance. The back three feel an odd alliance but they registered a clean sheet. Antonio Rudiger is a talismanic presence but he is heading off to Real Madrid. Thiago Silva is nearer his 38th birthday than his 37th. Trevoh Chalobah is the newcomer who, a couple of years ago, was playing in midfield for a Huddersfield team battling relegation to League One. He had a torrid start against Diaz and yet outlasted him, departing after 105 minutes after passing a test of character.</p></div></div> ', 'chelsea.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 342005, '2', 'May 15, 2022'),

I said, \'Really?\' They worked with us. This trophy is for them, too.\"</p><div><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">They’d clearly had an effect. An obvious response here is that Sadio Mane had his shot saved, but Klopp put some of the blame on himself. Given that Mane and Edouard Mendy are international teammates, the Liverpool manager advised his Senegalese forward to put his penalty to the other side.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">“The first time in my life I learned not to speak,” Klopp laughed.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">There is a serious point here.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Although Klopp is obviously a managerial figure of singular effect and charisma, one of his many qualities is the awareness to delegate; to listen.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Liverpool have employed many specialists that other football people have scoffed at, from those working on throw-ins to this. The true benefit is not the little gains but what it all adds up to. It raises the ceiling of the squad. It allows them to do more. There’s a multiplying effect. They may well be the smartest club in football.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Hence they can still go for all four trophies this late in the season.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">“The difference for me is that they can go again on Wednesday, and then Saturday,” Thomas Tuchel argued, his Chelsea team having drawn with Liverpool for the fourth time this season.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">“This is where the gap comes from. They can produce these performances more often. They have built this team for longer.”</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Klopp has now won every major trophy in that time. He can now win them all in one season. The German wasn’t getting ahead of himself, though.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">It would be wrong to say he was “resigned” to Manchester City winning the league, but he acknowledged how difficult it could be, as he pointed to the goal difference.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">In any other season, given how much Liverpool want the league, that could be deflating. Klopp said all this with a smile.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">That’s the effect of victory. It ensures an energy surges through this Liverpool team again. The quadruple is still alive. The squad are more than revived. They\'re ready to go again.</p></div></div>', 'liverpools.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 485810, '9', 'May 16, 2022'),

The result saw the Russian extend his winning streak to 10, with his last four victories having come via stoppage.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">It could be that Makhachev vs Dariush is rescheduled for some time in the coming months; that would be a fair call but would also leave Oliveira without an opponent for some time. More likely and perhaps more sensible is the option of pairing Oliveira (33-8, 1 No Contest) with Makhachev (22-1).</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Both men are in incredible form, and stylistically the match-up would be the closest fans could come to seeing Oliveira face his predecessor as lightweight champion: Khabib Nurmagomedov, a childhood friend of Makhachev who corners his compatriot.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">UFC 281 is scheduled for late October and will take place in Abu Dhabi.

But it is also means that they are a dangerous store of value, and are impractical to use in actual transactions.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Stablecoins are meant to solve that by giving a constant exchange rate with the dollar, making them easy to value and theoretically more akin to actual cash.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">But in recent days, stablecoins have proven to be anything but – with not only their own prices collapsing but that collapse helping bring about chaos right across the cryptocurrency markets.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The most notably unstable of those stablecoins is Terra, or UST. It has all but collapsed, losing almost all of its value.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The idea behind that cryptocurrency is that it is equal to the dollar – one USD buys one UST. For a long time, that was the case, but now one UST is worth less than a penny.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">That means that the cryptocurrency broke from its “peg”, which kept the two prices the same. It is that dramatic and unexpected event that caused ripples across the cryptocurrency market and dragged prices down.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Bitcoin has fallen almost 21 per cent over the last week, and the cryptocurrency market has dropped by 5.5 per cent over the last day. Trading volumes are also unusually high, as investors panic and look to sell their holdings.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">There is not necessarily any direct connection between the problems with stablecoins and the rest of the market. Beyond plunging sentiment, there is no reason for the crash of Terra or any other stablecoin to necessarily hit the rest of the market – but plunging sentiment is important in cryptocurrency, which often trades up or down on the back of emotions and current events.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Likewise, not all of the crash in the cryptocurrency market can be traced back to the problems with stablecoins. Cryptocurrency is also being hit by the same problems that are pulling down tech stocks: rising inflation, and worried investors who are keen to move back into less risky assets.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Stablecoins work in one of two ways: those that are asset-backed and those that are decentralised. It is really the latter that has caused the big problems.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Asset-backed stablecoins such as Tether are nominally more safe because the companies that run them hold reserves that back them. So there are real, actual dollars backing those other cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the dollar, which should keep the two prices the same.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">But asset-backed stablecoins are not entirely without criticism or concern.

In a strange appeals hearing before the court’s decision, one judge claimed that Twitter, Facebook, and other social media websites are “internet providers” and “are not websites”.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Some have argued the bill is unconstitutional because it amounts to government-mandated speech. “Texas HB 20 strips private online businesses of their speech rights, forbids them from making constitutionally protected editorial decisions, and forces them to publish and promote objectionable content,” said free speech trade association NetChoice counsel Chris Marchese in a press release.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">“The First Amendment prohibits Texas from forcing online platforms to host and promote foreign propaganda, pornography, pro-Nazi speech, and spam.”</p><div><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">However, the First Amendment also protects content including vaccine disinformation, Holocaust denialism, and terrorist content. Democratic representatives put forward a carve-out so social media companies could take down such content, but the Republican house defeated each attempt.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">As well as the Buffalo gunman’s video, this law would also force Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media platforms to allow content from the Taliban, ISIS, and other international terrorist organisations.</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Twitch did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent before time of publication.</p></div></div>  ', 'twitch.jpg', '', 'image/jpeg', 185390, '17', 'June 11, 2022'),
